# Photoalbum
Hello, this showcase is to display the title and photo ids in a photo album.  The photos are available at 
"(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos)."

I used the fetch api to display json data in an html file.

To access data:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Copy full path for index.html.
3. Paste full path on the web browser.
4. Open developer tools in browser (ctrl+shift+i).
5. Click on console tab and it should be displayed.
